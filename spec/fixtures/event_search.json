Formed in Venice, CA, during the early &#39;80s, the group&#39;s leader from the beginning was outspoken vocalist Mike Muir. The outfit specialized in vicious hardcore early on -- building a huge following among skateboarders, lending a major hand in the creation of skatepunk -- before turning their focus eventually to thrash metal. Early on, the group (whose original lineup included Muir, guitarist Grant Estes, bassist Louiche Mayorga, and drummer Amery Smith) found it increasingly difficult to book shows, due to rumors of its members&#39; affiliation with local gangs and consistent violence at their performances. The underground buzz regarding Suicidal Tendencies grew too loud for labels to ignore though, as the quartet signed on with the indie label Frontier; issuing Muir and company&#39;s classic self-titled debut in 1983. The album quickly became the best-selling hardcore album up to that point; its best-known track, &quot;Institutionalized,&quot; was one of the first hardcore punk videos to receive substantial airplay on MTV, and was eventually used in the Emilio Estevez cult classic movie Repo Man, as well as in an episode for the hit TV show Miami Vice (for which the group made a cameo appearance).Suicidal Tendencies proved influential for future speed/thrash metal bands, but despite its early success, the quartet&#39;s reputation preceded them, as no other record label was willing to take them on (in addition, Los Angeles banned the group from playing around this time, lasting until the early &#39;90s). Not much was heard from the group for several years afterward (leading many to believe that Suicidal had broken up), but Muir and company eventually found a home with Caroline Records. By this time, half of the original lineup had left; Muir and Mayorga were the only holdovers, while guitarist Rocky George and drummer R.J. Herrera rounded out the group. 1987 saw the release of Suicidal&#39;s sophomore release, Join the Army, which spawned another popular skatepunk anthem, &quot;Possessed to Skate,&quot; as more and more metal heads began to be spotted in Suicidal&#39;s audience. Soon after, Suicidal was finally offered a major-label contract (with Epic), as another lineup change occurred: Mayorga exited the band, while newcomer Bob Heathcote took his spot; and a second guitarist, Mike Clark, was added as well. This Suicidal lineup&#39;s first album together, 1988&#39;s How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can&#39;t Even Smile Today, showed that their transformation from hardcore to heavy metal was now complete, as did a compilation of two earlier EPs, 1989&#39;s Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...Dj Vu.Suicidal&#39;s first release of the new decade, 1990&#39;s Lights, Camera, Revolution, was another success; its video for the explosive &quot;You Can&#39;t Bring Me Down&quot; received repeated airings on MTV&#39;s Headbanger&#39;s Ball program, while the album (in addition to the Controlled by Hatred comp) would be certified gold in the U.S. a few years later. The release also signaled the arrival of new bassist Robert Trujillo, whose penchant for funk added a new element to the group&#39;s sound. The group tried to broaden their audience even further by opening a string of arena shows for prog-metallists Queensrche during the summer of 1991. Their next release, 1992&#39;s The Art of Rebellion, proved to be one of Suicidal&#39;s most musically experimental albums of their career. Muir and Trujillo also teamed up around this time for a funk metal side project, Infectious Grooves (including several other participants, such as Jane&#39;s Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins) and issued a debut release, The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move. Upset that the group&#39;s classic debut had been out of print for several years by this point, Muir decided to re-record the entire record with Suicidal&#39;s &#39;90s lineup under the title of Still Cyco After All These Years.But after one more release, 1994&#39;s Suicidal for Life, Suicidal Tendencies decided to hang it up. A pair of compilations were issued in 1997: a best-of set, Prime Cuts, plus Friends & Family. Muir and Trujillo continued to issue further Infectious Grooves releases (Sarsippius&#39; Ark and Groove Family Cyco), in addition to Muir pursuing a solo career under the alias of Cyco Miko (Lost My Brain Once Again) and Trujillo touring and recording as part of Ozzy Osbourne&#39;s solo band (appearing on Osbourne&#39;s 2001 release, Down to Earth). Muir formed a new version of Suicidal Tendencies in the late &#39;90s (with Clark being the only other familiar face), resulting in such further studio releases as 1999&#39;s Freedumb and 2000&#39;s Free Your Soul and Save My Mind. Muir and Trujillo joined forces once more for a fourth Infectious Grooves studio release in 2000, Mas Borracho; while another Cyco Miko release surfaced, Schizophrenic Born Again Problem Child, along with a follow-up up to their earlier compilation, Friends & Family, Vol. 2. After releasing the compilation &#39;Year Of The Cycos&#39; in 2009 that included a selection of all brand new songs from Suicidal Tendencies and side bands Infectious Grooves, NoMercyFool and Cyco Miko, the band released in 2010 the first record in 10 years &#39;No Mercy Fool!/The Suicidal Family&#39; that included re-recordings of classic jems off the &#39;Join The Army records&#39; and infamous recording &#39;Widespread Bloodshed&#39; for Mike Muir and Mike Clark side band No Mercy back in early eighties.Now the band will be back with their brand new album in 13 yearsStory has yet to be written!Line-up 2016:Mike Muir VocalsDave Lombardo DrumsDean Pleasants Lead GuitarJeff Pogan Rhythm GuitarRa Diaz Bass","modified":"2017-01-03 08:49:38","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":[{"creator":"tmfloria","linker":"evdb","name":"Suicidal Tendencies","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Suicidal-Tendencies?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000004849-8","short_bio":"LETS GET CYCO!"},{"creator":"DWE1","linker":"evdb","name":"Havok","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Havok?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000139739-1","short_bio":"Thrash Metal"},{"creator":"mosherboy420","linker":"evdb","name":"crowbar","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/crowbar?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000038102-9","short_bio":"CROWBAR"}]},"title":"Suicidal Tendencies","venue_address":"1902 Blake Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/612/779-7.jpeg_/suicidal-tendencies-79.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/000/612/779-7.jpeg_/suicidal-tendencies-79.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/612/779-7.jpeg_/suicidal-tendencies-79.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/000/612/779-7.jpeg_/suicidal-tendencies-79.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2017-01-03 08:49:38","venue_id":"V0-001-002192246-9","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Summit Music Hall","venue_url":"http://denver.eventful.com/venues/summit-music-hall-/V0-001-002192246-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Denver","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CO","postal_code":"80202","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"39.7535091","groups":null,"url":"http://denver.eventful.com/events/minus-bear-/E0-001-099383609-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-099383609-2","privacy":"1","city_name":"Denver","link_count":null,"longitude":"-104.9953151","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Colorado","start_time":"2017-03-12 19:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" with Beach Slang, Sand<br> For the past seven years, Seattle&#39;s Minus the Bear have orbited the music world like a distant meteor, fine-tuning their unique brand of indie rock and discovering how technology can help enhance the band&#39;s unique pop vision - all of which culminated with the full-length Planet of Ice , an album showing the band not so much transforming their sound as transcending it. In September, 2008, the band added the latest entry in their saga. Their EP Acoustics sees them taking a step back from electronics and electricity as they reworked fan favorites from past albums into compelling acoustic compositions. The EP, which will be available nationally at digital outlets such as emusic and iTunes (and in physical form exclusively on the road) includes a previously unreleased track as well in &quot;Guns & Ammo&quot;.Formed in Seattle, Washington in 2001, Minus the Bear was initially composed of guitarist David Knudson, bassist Cory Murchy, and drummer Erin Tate who eventually recruited keyboardist/sequencer, Matt Bayles and vocalist/guitarist Jake Snider. Once in the same room they realized they were on to something special - and the band quickly earned a rabid and rapidly growing fan base ranging from teenagers to middle-aged parents. &quot;I know every band says they can&#39;t explain their music, but I really can&#39;t say that we sound like one specific thing,&quot; Murchy explains. &quot;We don&#39;t follow a particular scene or genre and hopefully that shows.&quot;Acoustics revisits their prolific career with interpretations of songs plucked from their past exploits, including Planet of Ice - which saw the introduction of keyboardist Alex Rose. It was in secret that the band entered the new Redroom studio in Seattle to bang on some acoustic guitars, tambourines, swizzle stix, snare drums, organ pipes, and vocal chords. The final product should please the old guard and new fans alike.With Planet of Ice, the band allowed negative space and an airy openness to permeate their music; from the distinctively danceable opener &quot;Burying Luck&quot; to the syncopated sample-driven &quot;Knights&quot; to the album&#39;s epic 9 minute closer &quot;Lotus,&quot; which evokes acts like Yes and Pink Floyd, minus the self-indulgent tendencies. Although all the musicians in Minus the Bear are technically talented - as anyone who&#39;s seen Knudson&#39;s unique approach to the guitar which features two-handed tapping and live looping already knows - Planet of Ice showed the band focusing on songwriting instead of showiness.With Acoustics they had an opportunity to fully demonstrate their restraint as they stripped down songs to their core appeal, and revealed the attractive fundamentals that form the bedrock behind the original recordings.In true Minus the Bear fashion, the band are taking their acoustic interpretations on the road, where they&#39;ll perform songs from Acoustics as well as exclusively sell physical copies of the EP, otherwise available digitally at major online digital outlets. Upon wrapping up their tour prior to the holiday season, the band will take a short break before heading into the studio to begin recording their next full-length.","modified":"2017-01-12

The band&#39;s third full-length release, Life ...Is Not A Waiting Room, is no exception. Having the unenviable task of following 2006&#39;s crushing Still Searching, the album showcases the face-melting musicianship and soul-baring lyricism that define Senses Fail. Once again produced by helmsman Brian McTernan (Thrice, Circa Survive) and recorded in Baltimore, MD, at his Salad Days studio, Life boasts a towering sound akin to a roundhouse kick to the skull. &quot;This is the most fun we&#39;ve ever had as a band,&quot; says singer James &quot;Buddy&quot; Nielsen. &quot;I think we were feeling a lot less pressure this time around, but you&#39;ve always got to do your best.&quot; The New Jersey-based group formed six years ago and released their debut EP, From the Depths of Dreams, in 2002. 2004&#39;s Let It Enfold Youtheir first full-lengthwas followed by Still Searching, which debuted at 15 on the Billboard Top 200 chart. To date, Senses Fail have performed multiple worldwide tours and their catalog sales have reached over 850,000, yet the band continue to evolve. Although in many ways Life picks up seamlessly where Searching left off, the new album has very distinct, unique qualities, most notably its lyrical content. While Searching wrestled with issues regarding religion and depression, Life is centered squarely on a crumbling relationship, and the desire to see meaningful change. &quot;A lot of this record is written about the recent break up I had with a long-time girlfriend, the first person I have ever been in love with, and someone I spent a lot of time and shared my transition from kid to adult,&quot; explains Nielsen. &quot;The other elements of the record consist of regrets and how they can leave a burning hole in your soul; how the past is something you can&#39;t change.There are also bright moments where I find myself coming to terms with those very facts, and in knowing the problem you can then be proactive and change.&quot; Life also marks the addition of new bassist Jason Black (formerly of Hot Water Music), who replaces the departed Mike Glita. Meanwhile, guitarists Garrett Zablocki and Heath Saraceno (formerly of Midtown) have grown into one of the most scorching six-string tandems around; Life features more of the nimble harmonies showcased on Searching, but this time the duo took it one step further, with some truly shred-a-riffic leads, such as those heard on &quot;Lungs Like Gallows&quot; and &quot;Garden State.&quot; Another rocker, &quot;Wolves At The Door,&quot; was so intense that it even garnered a coveted spot within the soundtrack for the best-selling Madden NFL &#39;09 video game. Kicking off with the rich, moody &quot;Fireworks At Dawn,&quot; Life roars and pummels its way through the album&#39;s 12 tracks without the slightest pause for filler, delivering an absolute haymaker just four tracks in with &quot;Family Tradition,&quot; which features the band&#39;s signature blend of dark and melodic. Nielsen&#39;s words are as insightful as they are meaningful. &quot;I find myself at times doing things to live up to other peoples&#39; expectations, or cutting myself down because I assume that will make me look more humble to the world,&quot; says Nielsen. &quot;So this song is one part a reaction to that, and also about following the footsteps of a family member you don&#39;t really know, but who has had a huge influence on you.&quot; Perhaps the most heart-wrenching moments of all come via the two-part song cycle of &quot;Yellow Angels&quot; and &quot;Four Years,&quot; which were inspired by a terminally ill fan named Marcel, who befriended Nielsen at an SF show in Dallas, TX. Nielsen remained in contact with the 18-year-old, who was stricken with cancer of the soft tissue of his face, and endured many painful surgeries and treatments in order to attempt to fend off tumors that were growing in vital areas such as his eyes, nose and throat. When Marcel&#39;s mother notified Nielsen of her son&#39;s worsening condition, the singer flew to Texas, where he spent a great deal of time with this incredibly courageous young man, during the final days of his tragically short life. &quot;It was one of the most intense and stirring times in my life. The sheer pain this 18-year-old boy was in was mind blowing, yet his optimistic outlook and sense of humor was steadfast,&quot; Nielsen recalls. &quot;This kid changed my life and although he is no longer with us, he lives on everyday in the pictures I took with him, to remind myself that life is never as bad as you think it is. So &#39;Yellow Angels&#39; is my reaction to meeting Marcel and how I needed to live in the moment and love myself and life. &#39;Four Years,&#39; on the other hand, is about being influenced by such a life-changing [experience] and having to make new decisions about my relationship and what it really was.&quot; The album&#39;s title is a succinct, encapsulating statement as to its thematic thrust. Life Is Not A Waiting Room is just as much revelation as it is reflection; the sum total of every ounce of pain, fear, hope and joy that the record exudes. &quot;I felt I had been living as if I was waiting for something to happen, but I know that is the wrong way to liveit just doesn&#39;t promote any sort of happiness,&quot; Nielsen concludes. &quot;The title sums up the direction I want to go in, and what I want to get away from, and it&#39;s a cry to everyone else to stop living like I have.&quot; Just like the rest of us, Nielsen&#39;s struggle is far from over. But one thing is certain: SF have once again delivered their message with both passion and fury. All one has to do is listen with their ears and heart openjust as an old friend would.","modified":"2016-11-16 18:09:47","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":[{"creator":"matt_swn8","linker":"evdb","name":"Senses Fail","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Senses-Fail?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000002563-7","short_bio":"Screamo / Punk / Emo"},{"creator":"Counterpartsband","linker":"evdb","name":"Counterparts","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Counterparts?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000214086-0","short_bio":"Tinkling the Ivorys!"}]},"title":"Senses Fail","venue_address":"1902 Blake Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/003/571/976-5.jpeg_/senses-fail-76.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/003/571/976-5.jpeg_/senses-fail-76.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/003/571/976-5.jpeg_/senses-fail-76.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/003/571/976-5.jpeg_/senses-fail-76.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-11-16 18:09:47","venue_id":"V0-001-002192246-9","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Summit Music Hall","venue_url":"http://denver.eventful.com/venues/summit-music-hall-/V0-001-002192246-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Denver","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CO","postal_code":"80202","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"39.7535091","groups":null,"url":"http://denver.eventful.com/events/maine-/E0-001-099747537-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-099747537-6","privacy":"1","city_name":"Denver","link_count":null,"longitude":"-104.9953151","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Colorado","start_time":"2017-03-30 18:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" with The Mowglis, Beach Weather, 1000 Miles of Fire<br> The Maine is an American rock band from Tempe, Arizona.

That might very well be one of the biggest understatements in Nashville these days. Already in their career, the duo of Preston Brust and Chris Lucas have enjoyed hit singles, sold-out concert appearances here and abroad, and have tasted the top of the chart as two of Nashville&#39;s quickest-rising songwriters. But, to quote the old saying... You Ain&#39;t Seen Nothing Yet.Recently signing with Reviver Records, the duo is joining forces with some of the biggest names on the Country Music business landscape. Brust says they could feel the team&#39;s energy from the first meeting. &quot;We haven&#39;t felt an energy like this since the day we began our journey. This feels like it has all come together the right label head, the right promo team, it finally feels like we&#39;ve got all of our ducks in a row for the first time in our lives. We&#39;ve been out there doing the grass roots thing for so long, and to feel it all come together, is so encouraging.&quot;As The LoCash Cowboys, the duo have made a presence at radio with such records as the feel-good anthem of &quot;Here Comes Summer,&quot; and the tender emotions of &quot;Keep In Mind,&quot; and &quot;Best Seat In The House.&quot; With a new name, there is an underlying current of new and exciting energy, but the music is the same style their fans have come to know. &quot;We&#39;ve been doing this for ten years now, and I sort of feel like we have grown up a little bit in the business. We&#39;ve matured in the business, and learned how it all works. We just wanted to simplify things and get down to the roots of what we are all about. That&#39;s what LOCASH means anyway is remembering where you come from, and your roots. Because of that, we decided to go with LOCASH and just keep it real simple. Everybody calls us that to begin with. I think we&#39;ll always be referred to as LoCash Cowboys out there somewhere, which is ok. That&#39;s how we started.&quot;That part together happened at Nashville&#39;s Wildhorse Saloon, where the pair worked together in the club&#39;s DJ booth. They talked about their influences which range from Gospel (Preston&#39;s great-uncle was Gospel legend Albert Brumley) to Rock and Roll bands such as Motley Crue and Quiet Riot. The two also talked about their dreams of a career in the business, which have come true beyond their wildest imagination though they are far from done writing the chapters to their story. An integral part of that LOCASH book is their songwriting. &quot;I think that part of what we do reflects our different personalities, and what has happened in our lives,&#39; says Lucas. &quot;The passing of my father was &#39;The Best Seat In The House.&#39; Preston and I still write things like that. But, a lot of times, as songwriters, you get to go in someone else&#39;s world, and try to think about what you would do in a situation. Some days, I feel like hearing something upbeat, and when there&#39;s a lot of stuff going on in the world, we want to bring something a little fresh and make people want to roll down the window and smile. Then, there are songs that you have for when you&#39;ve loved someone so much in your life, and you don&#39;t want to let them go like your wife and your kids, we have those songs too. It&#39;s day by day what we write, and I don&#39;t think any of that has changed. I just think the sound of it has evolved. We&#39;re so excited to put it out so people can hear it.&quot;The duo has seen their profiles rise in the business thanks to a pair of hit singles from two of the format&#39;s most iconic voices. &quot;I think having Keith Urban recording &#39;You Gonna Fly,&#39; and giving us our first number one song really changed it all, and Tim McGraw doing &#39;Truck Yeah&quot; a few months later was huge to us as songwriters. That was his comeback single on Big Machine, and to be a part of that was a great moment,&quot; said Brust. And, the cuts keep coming! &quot;We just got a cut from Joe Nichols,&quot; he continues. &quot;I think our songwriting really adds value to what we&#39;re about. Sometimes, as songwriters, you write hundreds of songs, and you never know if people are on the money with what you&#39;re doing or not, and then all of a sudden, somebody like a Keith Urban, Tim McGraw, or Joe Nichols cuts your songs, and it just makes you feel that someone is really listening and they appreciate what you do. It&#39;s a reminder of why you get up everyday and do what you do.&quot; LOCASH has made believers out of Nashville, radio, and the corporate world, as well. They have earned endorsement deals from Dean Guitars, Under Armour and Mossy Oak apparel, Comcast, Bud Light, and Bowtick Bows and Crossbows, as well as Kicker Audio, who sponsored their &quot;Livin&#39; Loud&quot; tour. Their love of the outdoors has led to appearances on such lifestyle-oriented TV series as All Star Cast. Chris and Preston also believe in giving back to their community, by participating in such charities as D.A.R.E., St. Jude&#39;s Children&#39;s Hospital, and the T.J. Martell Foundation.Other highlights on the LOCASH resume include performances on the TODAY Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, in Times Square in New York City on New Years&#39; Eve, as well as their debut at the historic stage of the Grand Ole Opry. Lucas also has great memories of taking their music abroad. &quot;We have been able to take LOCASH worldwide. We&#39;ve done some stuff in Germany and Switzerland, and we do a lot for the United States Military. Those shows always turn out to be some of the best shows we&#39;ve ever done because when you&#39;re overseas, and they don&#39;t get the American music, it&#39;s great to bring that to them. I&#39;m an Army brat. My father, his grandfather, and great grandfather all were, and I&#39;m the only one who didn&#39;t. We really take advantage of every chance to perform for our troops, which is something we will always do. It&#39;s a highlight not only of our careers, but also our lives.&quot;All along the way, the group is mindful of those who have stuck with them since day one the fans. &quot;There&#39;s ups and there are downs, but one thing about our fans, they are faithful and loyal whether you are No. 1 or last place on a chart,&quot; admitted Brust. &quot;They don&#39;t care what label you&#39;re on as long as someone is paying attention and wants to get the music out to them. That&#39;s when they get fired up. They want to see us in the spotlight because they have stood by us for so long. There are days where we can get a little down sometimes, and the fans pick us up during a show, and make us want to keep on going down the road. I think they have fueled us as much as we&#39;ve fueled them.&quot; That hunger for their music by the audience has accounted for (to date) ten million views on YouTube.The coming year will bring the fans what they have been clamoring for new music. And, with the ultimate All-Star team at Reviver in play, Lucas says that the future is bright. &quot;We know we can make this new record deal very successful. We&#39;ve done our due diligence. We have throw kindling all over the place, and it&#39;s time to light it. We&#39;ve got a lot of great fans and people who believe in us. I don&#39;t think you can be in a better position than what we are right now. We have studied with the best, and &quot;For The First Time Ever,&quot; we are confident that our songs and live performances are at the top of their game, so get ready to experience Livin&#39; Loud with LOCASH.&quot;","modified":"2016-12-11 16:06:19","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"AverageJoesEnt","linker":"evdb","name":"LoCash","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/LoCash-Cowboys?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000023069-1","short_bio":"Country Duo"}},"title":"LOCASH","venue_address":"1902 Blake Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/003/572/412-9.jpeg_/locash-12.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/003/572/412-9.jpeg_/locash-12.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/003/572/412-9.jpeg_/locash-12.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/003/572/412-9.jpeg_/locash-12.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-09-19 21:31:47","venue_id":"V0-001-002192246-9","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Summit Music Hall","venue_url":"http://denver.eventful.com/venues/summit-music-hall-/V0-001-002192246-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"}]}}
